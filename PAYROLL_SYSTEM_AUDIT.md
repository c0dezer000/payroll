## Mapping to this repo (status + pointers)

- Employee management: Partial
  - Evidence: `src/data/employees.ts` provides seed data; `src/components/EmployeeList.tsx` + modal changes implement UI for adding/editing employees.
  - Gaps: No persistent storage (DB) or import/export UI; validation and duplicate-ID checks need confirmation.
  - Next: Add API routes or persistence layer (SQLite/Postgres), server-side validation, and CSV/Excel import.

- Payroll processing engine: Partial
  - Evidence: `src/utils/payroll.ts` contains calculation logic; `src/components/PayrollProcessing.tsx` provides processing UI and progress tracking.
  - Gaps: No scheduled/background jobs (cron), no multi-period batching or approval workflows.
  - Next: Add server-side runner, job queue, and approval steps.

- Allowances & deductions handling: Present (logic) / Partial (workflow)
  - Evidence: `src/types/index.ts` defines allowance/deduction types; `src/utils/payroll.ts` computes holiday allowance, tips distribution, etc.
  - Gaps: UI for admin to manage allowance types dynamically, and per-pay-period overrides.

- Taxes & compliance calculations: Partial
  - Evidence: Basic tax fields and simple calculations in `src/utils/payroll.ts` and `src/data/employees.ts`.
  - Gaps: Country-specific tax rules, progressive tax bands, year-end reporting not implemented.
  - Next: Implement configurable tax rules module and tax-report exports.

- Overtime & shift calculations: Partial
  - Evidence: `overtimeRate` in employee data and some overtime handling in payroll utils.
  - Gaps: No timesheet integration or scheduled shift handling; rounding rules unclear.

- Tips distribution and shared allowances: Present (logic)
  - Evidence: `src/utils/payroll.ts` indicates tips distribution functions and employee allowances include tips.
  - Gaps: UI to input collective tips, and audit trail for manual adjustments.

- Holiday & leave handling: Partial
  - Evidence: `holidaySettings` per employee in `src/data/employees.ts` and holiday allowance logic in payroll utils.
  - Gaps: No leave request workflow, no calendar UI for admins, no accrual rules.

- Payslip generation: Partial
  - Evidence: `src/components/PaySlipGenerator.tsx` supports PDF/WhatsApp export UI and templates.
  - Gaps: Server-side PDF generation/export automation and email delivery; signed/secure payslips.

- Payroll schedule, approvals & audit trail: Missing
  - Evidence: No explicit scheduling, approval flows, or audit-log components found in the scanned files.
  - Next: Add a payroll run entity, approve/reject endpoints, and an immutable audit trail.

- Time & attendance integration: Missing
  - Evidence: No timesheet or attendance import/integration code.
  - Next: Integrate with biometric/timeclock or CSV import, add timesheet UI.

- Benefits & deductions (insurance, loans, cooperative fund): Partial
  - Evidence: `deductions` in employee records (insurance, loanDeduction, cooperativeFund, healthInsurance).
  - Gaps: Automated loan schedules, premium calculations, employer vs employee share handling.

- Reporting & dashboards: Partial
  - Evidence: Dashboard components and `src/components/PayrollProcessing.tsx` summary cards exist.
  - Gaps: Exportable, filterable reports (by period/department), scheduled reports.

- Accounting / payroll export: Missing/Partial
  - Evidence: No explicit GL export or accounting integration. CSV/Excel export not found.
  - Next: Add export module producing journal entries and mapping to accounting codes.

- Authentication & authorization: Partial
  - Evidence: Workspace contains login/auth pages (per summary) but role-based checks across payroll actions unclear.
  - Gaps: Enforced RBAC for sensitive actions, audit logging.

- Notifications (email/WhatsApp/push): Partial
  - Evidence: PaySlipGenerator mentions WhatsApp export; no system notifications or email engine found.
  - Next: Integrate email service (SMTP/SendGrid) and push/WhatsApp API if required.

- Data import/export & backups: Missing/Partial
  - Evidence: Seed data present; no admin import/export or backup scripts discovered.
  - Next: Provide CSV/XLSX import/export and backup/export endpoints.

- Multi-currency / multi-country support: Missing
  - Evidence: All sample data in single currency; no currency fields, localization, or multi-country tax logic.

- Tests & CI: Missing/Partial
  - Evidence: No unit/integration tests seen for payroll utils or components in the scanned files.
  - Next: Add unit tests for `src/utils/payroll.ts`, component tests for critical flows, and a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions).

## Quality gates & verification
- Quick checks recommended before shipping:
  - Add unit tests for payroll calculation edge cases (zero salary, negative deductions, high overtime, tip rounding).
  - Lint / typecheck the repo (tsc, eslint, prettier).
  - Smoke-run the payslip generator and payroll runner on a small dataset.

## Assumptions I made
- The repo is a frontend-first Next.js app with in-memory/seed data (no DB). I assumed server-side job scheduling is not implemented because no API routes or server workers were referenced in the scanned files.
- Country-specific rules (tax, statutory contributions) are intentionally out of scope until requirements are provided.

## Priority roadmap (recommended next steps)
1. Add persistence (simple DB + API routes). Map employee CRUD to DB. (High)
2. Stabilize payroll engine server-side and add unit tests for `src/utils/payroll.ts`. (High)
3. Add payroll run entity with approvals and audit trail. (High)
4. Implement payslip export/email automation and scheduled runs. (Medium)
5. Add time & attendance integration and import tools. (Medium)
6. Add reporting exports and accounting export mappings. (Medium)

## Requirements coverage (quick mapping)
- Employee CRUD: Partial
- Payroll calc engine: Partial
- Payslip PDF/export: Partial
- Taxes: Partial
- Overtime: Partial
- Holiday rules: Partial
- Time & attendance: Missing
- Approvals/audit: Missing
- Accounting export: Missing
- Tests/CI: Missing

If you'd like, I can now:
- create issues/PR checklist for the top 3 roadmap items, or
- scaffold API routes plus a small SQLite persistence layer and unit tests for the payroll utils.

Pick one and I'll implement it in the repo next.
